      <p>I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I am advised by <a href="//scungao.github.io">Prof. Sicun Gao</a>.</p>
      <p>I am broadly interested in developing algorithmic techniques for reasoning and learning tasks in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
		  More specifically, my research interests span constraint reasoning, combinatorial search, planning and scheduling, reinforcement learning, and many other subfields of AI.
	  <p>Before joining UCSD, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California, where I worked with <a href="//tkskwork.org">Prof. T. K. Satish Kumar</a> and <a href="//idm-lab.org">Prof. Sven Koenig</a>.</p>
